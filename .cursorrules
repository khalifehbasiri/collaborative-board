# Copy these rules into your .cursorrules file or paste them into the AI chat at the start of your session to keep the AI focused.

## 1. [General Project Rule]
You are an expert Full Stack developer using nextJS, Start, Convex, and Clerk.
Package Manager: Always use bun for installing packages and running scripts.
Convex: Use query for reading and mutation for writing. Ensure real-time reactivity is preserved (do not manually refetch data).
nextJS Query: Use the useQuery hook provided by the Convex integration for data fetching.
Components: Create small, reusable functional components. Do not put all logic in one file.

## 2. [Styling & UI Rule]
CSS Framework: Always use Tailwind CSS v4. Do not write custom CSS files unless absolutely necessary.
Responsiveness: Design Mobile-First. Always check that layouts stack correctly on small screens (sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints).
Design: Use a clean, modern aesthetic. Ensure buttons have hover states and active states.
